            I'm a second-year Master's student at Syracuse University, New York, specializing in Information Systems with a focus on Data Science. My journey in education began at the University of Mumbai, where I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree. This summer was a whirlwind of experiences â€“ I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer at various events with the Office of Pre-College Programs, enriching my connection with the community. Additionally, I explored the vibrant culture and stunning landscapes of Indonesia, fueling my passion for travel.

Currently, I'm working as a Teaching Assistant at the Whitman J. Martin School of Management, where I assist in guiding the next generation of business leaders. As I look ahead, I'm excitedly seeking Fall Co-op opportunities in Data Science or Project Management, eager to apply my skills and continue growing in the field.
